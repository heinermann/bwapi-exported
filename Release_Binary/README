1. Introduction to BWAPI
------------------------
     The Brood War Application Programming Interface (BWAPI) is a free and open
  source C++ framework for creating AI modules for Starcraft: Broodwar. Using
  BWAPI, programmers can retrieve information on players and individual units
  in Starcraft as well as issue a wide variety of commands to units, opening
  the doors for custom AIs with new micro and macro algorithms.

     The installer contains all the necessary include files, libs, and dlls
  required to compile and run an AI module and also comes with three projects
  to help get you started in AI development with BWAPI:

    - Example AI Module - This project shows how to build an AI module DLL which
                          is the standard way of making autonomous agents with
                          BWAPI. The Example AI Module shows how to print
                          "Hello world!" along with a bit of example code that
                          shows how to read information about the units in the
                          game.

    - Example AI Client - This project shows how to build an AI client program,
                          which is an experimental new way of making AIs for
                          BWAPI. Like the Example AI Module project, this
                          project shows how to print "Hello world!" along with a
                          bit of example code that shows how to read information
                          about the units in the game.

    - AI Module Loader  - This project is a very simple AI client program which
                          can load and run Example AI Module DLLs, essentially
                          a way of making your AI Module run in a seperate
                          process without actually converting it to a client
                          program.
                          
    - Example Tournament Module - This project shows how to build a tournament module which
                                  can manage tournaments by limiting what the AI module can
                                  do and control the flow of the game without altering the
                                  AI module itself. The tournament module is only available
                                  in RELEASE mode.

  Build Instructions:
    1. Run the installer and go to the installation directory.

    2. Open ExampleProjects.sln in Visual C++ 2010 and build the solution.

  All projects should now be built and can be found in the solution directory's Release or
  Debug subdirectories.

  To run the Example AI Module:
    1. Copy Release/ExampleAIModule.dll to
       <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/AI/ExampleAIModule.dll

    2. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai to
       bwapi-data/AI/ExampleAIModule.dll if it isn't already.
       
    3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked. You can also check W-MODE
       to have Broodwar run in a window rather than full-screen (if not using BWAPI's windowed mode).

    4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.

     
  To run the Example AI Client:
    1. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai to NULL (or some
       other file name that doesn't exist).

    2. Run Release/ExampleAIClient.exe

    3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked.

    4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.

2. Basic AI Module
------------------
   The Example AI Module mainly just shows how to set everything up to make an
AI module for BWAPI. Once you understand how the Example AI Module works, you
may be interested the Basic AI Module from the BWSAL project, which aims to
develop several robust components which execute basic tasks, such as
constructing buildings, training units, gathering resources, and build-order
management. For more information, visit:  http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/

3. Bug Reports
--------------
   BWAPI is not perfect. As you write custom AI modules using BWAPI you may run
into bugs or other problems. We cannot find all the bugs on our own so your
feedback is invaluable and can be very helpful for improving BWAPI. When you
find a bug, please contact us on the IRC or file an issue at
   http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/issues/list

Additionally, if the program experienced an exception, then a log will be created in
   <starcraft folder>/Errors/
which may be useful.
   
Thank you for using BWAPI.
